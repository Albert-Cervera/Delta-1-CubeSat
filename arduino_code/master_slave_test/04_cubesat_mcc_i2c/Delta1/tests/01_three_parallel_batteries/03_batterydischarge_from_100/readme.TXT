Context:

1) Batteries: 3x 18650 batteries in parallel of 2800 mAh each, hence giving a total
8,400 mAh battery.

2) I know from previous tests that consumption is ESM: 24h 00m: 1,731 mAh, energy: 8,853 mWh

Experiment: 

I left running the CubeSat again with the USB-Meter and batteries fully charged and let go to see how it handled.
This time it ran 9 hrs, 40 mins and 41 secs. Batteries JUST gave 307 mAH and 1,540 mWh.
