#Battery discharge test with new battery threshold

UPDATE: Yesterday after analysis, I modified the SM battery condition from 10% to 0% threshold, and also I connected the battery to the charger, its been 25 hours now, and it has 101.93% and 4201.25 mV.
Min: 101.77 % || Max: 101.93 %
I'll disconnect the charger, dump the SD card data and connect CubeSat to a new battery discharge test.

16:04 UTC: Connected CubeSat to SPM, first transmission showed 96.55% of battery and 4156.25 mV

April 25 18:35 UTC: I've dumped the sd data into my Mac, so I can analyze the data. battery is fully depleted.
