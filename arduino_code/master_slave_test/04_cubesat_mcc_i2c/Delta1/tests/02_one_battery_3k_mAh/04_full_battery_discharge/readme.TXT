#New discharge Efest battery test (no USB-meter)

April 22 UTC 

 1:26 UTC: CubeSat connected to the SPM with the efest battery at full capacity. Actually, first reading was: 97.18%, 4158.75 mV (even though mins ago  was showing 101% and 4200.00 mV). ESM was activated so first ESM reading should be at 1:30 UTC.

1:30 UTC: 97.18 %, 4148.75 mV

Safe Mode activated: 16:50 UTC April 22nd.

Las transmission received: April 23rd 6:47 UTC: 0.0%, 2,523.75 mV.

From this test, seems like the SM lasted more than ESM, indicating the physically the Effect battery has the real capacity to keep CubeSat transmitting for more than 24 hours, leading into thinking that the battery gauge percentage is very wrong. A code review is required.

I'll dump the data from SD card.
