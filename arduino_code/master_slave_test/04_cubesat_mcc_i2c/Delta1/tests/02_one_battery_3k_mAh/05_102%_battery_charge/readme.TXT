#Battery discharge test with new battery threshold

UPDATE: Yesterday after analysis, I modified the SM battery condition from 10% to 0% threshold, and also I connected the battery to the charger, its been 25 hours now, and it has 101.93% and 4201.25 mV.
I'll disconnect the charger, dump the SD card data and connect CubeSat to a new battery discharge test.
