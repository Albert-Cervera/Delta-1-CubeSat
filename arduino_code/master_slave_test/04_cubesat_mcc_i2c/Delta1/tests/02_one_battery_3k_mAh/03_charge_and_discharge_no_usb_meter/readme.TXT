#Recharging with Cubesat connected

15:25 UTC: I connected the satellite to the SPM with no USB-Meter to the remaining battery charge, and it transmitted a msg with SM activated. I connected the charger (samsung brick) to the SPM to see how it charges and handles while spacecraft is connected.

After it recovers, I'll activate ESM.

At 16:21 UTC: spacecraft had 12.84 % at 3779.97 mV; it was transmitting data in RTWI mode.  I've just change it to ESM.

21:20 UTC: 99.40%, 4183.75 mV

21:50 UTC: 99.87%, 4186.25 mV. 
It's been 6 hours 30 mins roughly. I'll disconnect the charger once CubeSat reaches 100% and then let it run on ESM without the USB-Meter connected to it.

22:00 UTC: 99.87% 4186.25 mV, it seems like the SPM is protecting the battery from being over charged. I'll let it running a bit more.

#Battery test without USB-Meter
